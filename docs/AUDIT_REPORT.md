## ✅ Security Assessment - PASSED

### No Critical Issues Found

✓ **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All API keys are properly encrypted  
✓ **No Personal Information**: No emails, names, or identifiable data in code  
✓ **No Leaked Secrets**: No `.env`, `.pem`, or `.key` files committed  
✓ **Proper .gitignore**: Correctly excludes sensitive files  
✓ **Secure Encryption**: Uses PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations) with SHA256  
✓ **OS Keychain Integration**: Master passwords stored securely  
✓ **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines master password + hardware ID  
✓ **File Permissions**: Config files automatically set to 0o600  

### Security Features Implemented

1. **API Key Management**
   - Encrypted storage using `cryptography.fernet`
   - PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
   - OS keychain for master password (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager)
   - Hardware UUID binding

2. **Sensitive File Protection**
   - `.audiobookshelf_keys` properly ignored
   - Download directories excluded
   - Virtual environments excluded
   - IDE configs excluded

## 🔧 Code Quality Assessment

### Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **Inconsistent Constants**: Fixed `DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_PATH` vs `DOWNLOAD_PATH` usage
   - Now consistently uses `DOWNLOAD_PATH` from `config.py` across all files
   - Removed duplicate constant definitions

### Code Quality Score: **A**

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured async/await patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Good separation of concerns
- Proper use of context managers
- Informative logging
- Type hints in function signatures

**Minor Observations:**
- Very long files (server_diff.py: 931 lines, api_key_manager.py: 700 lines)
- Some functions could be broken down further
- Limited unit test coverage
